# Synergy — AI-Powered Applicant Tracking System

A full-stack recruitment management platform built with Django REST Framework. Synergy streamlines the end-to-end hiring pipeline — from job requisition approval to interview scheduling — with AI-assisted resume screening powered by the Groq LLM API and a RAG-based semantic matching engine.

## Features

- **Role-based access** — HR managers, recruiters, and interviewers each have scoped permissions via custom DRF permission classes
- **Job requisition workflow** — departments raise hiring requirements; HR approves or rejects with comments before recruiting begins
- **Resume management** — single and bulk PDF resume uploads with OCR fallback for scanned documents (Tesseract + pdf2image)
- **AI resume screening** — resumes are scored against job requirements using the Groq LLM; results are cached on the model to avoid repeated API calls
- **RAG-based semantic matching** — resumes are chunked using section-based splitting, embedded, and stored in a single ChromaDB collection (`resumes`); incoming job descriptions are embedded and compared against stored resume chunks using cosine similarity to surface the best-matching candidates
- **Kanban pipeline** — candidates move through stages: Applied → Screening → Shortlisted → Interview Scheduled → Selected / Rejected
- **SharePoint integration** — fetches resumes directly from a SharePoint document library via the Microsoft Graph API; when a candidate's status changes to *Shortlisted*, their profile/resume is automatically pushed back to SharePoint
- **Interview scheduling** — schedule interviews, record interviewer notes, and send confirmation emails via Mailtrap (dev) or any SMTP provider
- **JWT authentication** — access + refresh tokens with rotation and blacklisting on logout
- **Auto-generated API docs** — Swagger UI available at `/api/docs/`

## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema

The ER diagram below shows the core entities — Employee, Department, Role, Skill, Requirement, Resume, and Interview — and how they relate.

![ER Diagram](./docs/screenshots/er-diagram.png)

### RAG Resume Matching Pipeline

1. Resume PDFs are parsed (with OCR fallback for scanned documents)
2. Text is split using **section-based chunking** (e.g. Experience, Education, Skills sections kept intact rather than arbitrary token windows)
3. Each chunk is embedded and stored in a single ChromaDB collection (`resumes`), tagged with candidate/resume metadata
4. When a new job description (JD) comes in, it's embedded the same way
5. **Cosine similarity** is computed between the JD embedding and stored resume chunk embeddings to rank candidates by relevance

### SharePoint Sync Flow

- **Inbound:** resumes are fetched from a configured SharePoint document library via Microsoft Graph API and ingested into the pipeline
- **Outbound:** when a candidate's pipeline status is updated to `Shortlisted`, their record is automatically pushed/synced back to SharePoint
